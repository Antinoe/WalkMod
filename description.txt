A simple mod involving precise Movement Control, Sprinting, Crawling and Resting mechanics.

**Walking**
-Toggle/Hold or hold the "Run" keybind to temporarily turn off Walking.
-Increase/Decrease speed using the respective keybinds. (Individual Walk Speeds can be configured in the Client Config.)

**Sprinting**
-Hold keybind to Sprint. (Mechanic can be turned off in the Config.)
-There is an option to consume Mana when Sprinting.

**Crawling**
-Toggle keybind to crawl within tight spaces. (Mechanic can be turned off in the Config.)

**Resting**
-Toggle "Lay Down" keybind to lay down on the ground, which raises your "Rest" stat.
-Upon reaching a configured point, you will be granted a "Rested" buff. If laying down for longer, you will eventually be granted an additional "Well Rested" buff.
-These may include buffs for Defense, Endurance and Life Regeneration.
